### Inspiration
I found myself with nothing to do on a saturday morning. And since I play basketball quite often, we usually just use shot clock apps that are currently in play store. And so, I thought, "why not create one of my own?". That's when I decided to create this app as a past time on a one boring saturday. :joy:
